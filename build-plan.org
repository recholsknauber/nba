# Building an NBA model

** Basic Ideas, in order of complexity

*** Now
**** Project environment
***** Creating html from org with javascript data pulls in-line.
***** Get started with Vu/React as needed--the user should be able to enter player names and see associated stats.
***** From there, we can 
**** Predict winners game by game--focusing first on the Dallas Mavericks.
***** Is a starting lineups PER (average?) predictive of how they will perform in games?
***** Test: how much money would someone have made if they started using the model at the beginning of the season?
*** Harder
- Find the most underused/underpaid players in the NBA
- Predict who will win an NBA game based on player level stats

*** Really hard
- Pull data from game recordings
- Set up NBA game simulations to predict game winner likelihood


** Current Plan
*** Start with "Predict who will win the NBA Finals in a season, based on reg season team stats"
1. Data pull and munging of reg season team stats, in organized code structure.
2. Visualization and EDA.
3. Feature engineering, reduction, and scaling.
4. Grid search.
