# Building an NBA model

## Basic Ideas, in order of complexity

### Easier
- Predict who will win the NBA Finals in a season, based on reg season team stats
- Predict which highest round NBA playoffs each team will achieve in a season, based on team stats

### Harder
- Find the most underused/underpaid players in the NBA
- Predict who will win an NBA game based on player level stats

### Really hard
- Set up NBA game simulations to predict game winner likelihood


## Current Plan
#### Start with "Predict who will win the NBA Finals in a season, based on reg season team stats"
1. Data pull and munging of reg season team stats, in organized code structure.
2. Visualization and EDA.
3. Feature engineering, reduction, and scaling.
4. Grid search.
